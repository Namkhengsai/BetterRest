# Introduction
This app is my project I build along the way during the Paul Hudson's 100DaysOfSwiftUI course.

# BetterRest
Better rest is an app to calculate your ideal sleep time by considering user's daily coffee intake, user's desired amount of sleep, and user's wake up time. 
This project introduced me with the knowledge of CoreML that use for creating machine learning model specifically for Swift programming language. 
For this project I use CoreML to create linear regression model by using feature from the dataset.
