## Overview
Better Rest is an app that calculates your ideal sleep time by considering your daily coffee intake, desired amount of sleep, and wake-up time. This project introduced me to CoreML, which is used for creating machine learning models specifically in Swift. For this project, I used CoreML to create a linear regression model based on features from the dataset (for learning purposes only, not intended for medical use). 

## Skills Learned
* Entering numbers with Stepper
* Selecting dates and times with DatePicker
* Working with dates
* Training a model with Create ML
